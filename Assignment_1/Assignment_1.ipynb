    "The objective is to get acquainted with the Python language, with emphasis on its scientific and numerical extensions, how data can be imported from other data sources, linear algebra basics that is needed in this course, visualization using principal component analysis (PCA) and the concept of similarity. Upon completing this exercise it is expected that you:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand how data can be represented as vectors and matrices in numerical Python (NumPy).\n",
    "- Can apply and interpret principal component analysis (PCA) for data visualization.\n",
    "- Understand the various measures of similarity such as Jaccard and Cosine similarity and apply similarity measures to query for similar observations.\n",
